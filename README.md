New Zealand's housing is cold, damp, mouldy. Lack of heating and insulation means that homes are ill-equipped to deal with winter temperatures. These poor conditions are linked to increased illnesses and infection. Our homes are making us sick. 

To fix a problem (and convince people to fix it) you must first measure it. 

These simple sensors will measure the temperature and humidity of a room. To work, they must be
* Very low cost 
* Respect the privacy of the occupant 
* Be, look and feel friendly and safe 

For a subset of the deployments, they must work: 
* without internet 
* without power supply 

This is an arduino UNO sheild. It runs on 5V from micro USB (using 2nd hand phone chargers). It can be built in 10 minutes. It currently costs about NZ$20 per unit.
